# Loan eligibility project

In this mini-project, I practice some Databricks skills. I upload a small
example dataset about eligibility of various applicants for loans to Unity
Catalog. I use a [notebook](notebooks/explore_data.ipynb) for exploring the
dataset with PySpark, then later use the [SQL Editor for queries that eventually comprise a dashboard](dashboard.md). The final dashboard looked like this:
