# Databricks Projects

Welcome to my repo! I performed two small projects here to practice data 
engineering with Databricks. Overall, I gained experience with the overall
lakehouse architecture, Unity Catalog, notebooks, the SQL Editor, dashboards,
workflows, and more.

For the most comprehensive project, check out what I did with the classic
titanic dataset in [the titanic project](https://github.com/Nick-Eagles/data_engineering_practice/tree/master/databricks/titanic_project). A
[shorter project](https://github.com/Nick-Eagles/data_engineering_practice/tree/master/databricks/loan_project)
works with a loan-eligibility dataset.
